Bash scripts for random (stupid) ideas that cross my mind.

1. restaurant_check.sh

Checks every X minutes if the restaurant is open, when (if) restaurant opens, you get clickable textual banner alert on screen which leads you to the site, while custom AI voice says it has opened, it is time to order. Can be crontabed so it runs Mon-Fri at custom hours. Probably will add feature that it scans the page for meals that are served that day (eg. every meal which has chicken in it) just for fun.
